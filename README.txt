Execution Instructions-

1. The "bnserver.jar" will take in two input file names 1>configFile 2>dataFile as command line arguments and start up the whole consistent hashing system on its run.
2. The "nameserver.jar" will take in one input file 1>configFile and on its run contact the bnserver, take its share of key_value space along with data.
3. Make sure that bnserver.jar and its config file, data file stay together in same folder.
4. Make sure that nameserver.jar and its config file stay together in same folder.
5. Please do not change config file's or data file's format (i.e key=value pairs). However, the sequence of config properties can be interchanged.
   For reference you can check the config files provided in submission zip folder.
6. Command for bnserver execution
     java -jar bnserver.jar <Config File Name> <Data File Name>

   Command for nameserver execution
     java -jar nameserver.jar <Config File Name>
